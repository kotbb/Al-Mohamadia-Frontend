# Implementation Phases

> This file is duplicated identically in `Al-Mohamadia-Backend/docs/` and
> `Al-Mohamadia-Frontend/docs/` so each project has full system context
> without needing to open the other repo. Keep both copies in sync.

This project is built as a series of **vertical slices**: each phase
delivers a complete, end-to-end feature (DB schema → NestJS module → Next.js
pages), validated by actually driving the real frontend against the real
backend, before the next phase starts. Do not build "the whole backend"
then "the whole frontend" — and do not silently expand a phase's scope.

Update this file's checkboxes/status as phases complete (in both copies),
and update `docs/DATABASE.md` (backend) / `docs/Design-System.md` (frontend) /
`docs/OVERVIEW.md` in the same PR whenever a phase changes the
schema or business rules.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

No business feature yet; this unblocks every later phase.

**Backend**
- MongoDB connection module, global `@nestjs/config` + validation
- Global exception filter, consistent API response/error shape
- `AuditLog` schema + a shared `AuditService` other modules will call later
- API versioning under `/api/v1`, health check endpoint

**Frontend**
- Tailwind theme tokens wired from `docs/Design-System.md` (light/dark CSS variables)
- i18n setup: `ar` (default, RTL) / `en` (LTR) routing + dictionaries
- Root layout with `dir` + theme toggle + language toggle
- Shared API client wrapper (base URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
- Shared app shell (sidebar/nav placeholder, empty/loading/error states)

**Done when:** both apps run; you can flip language and theme in the
browser; the frontend successfully calls the backend's health endpoint.

---

## Phase 1 — Auth & Users

**Backend**
- `User`, `RefreshToken` schemas
- Register (super_admin only), login, refresh, logout endpoints
- JWT access + refresh token issuance/rotation (hashed refresh token storage)
- Role guards: `super_admin`, `admin`
- Seed script for the first super admin account

**Frontend**
- Login page
- Auth context/store, token refresh handling in the API client
- Protected route wrapper
- Super-admin-only "manage admins" page (create / deactivate admin)

**Done when:** you can log in as super admin from the UI, create an admin,
log in as that admin, and confirm the admin cannot access user-management
UI or API routes.

---

## Phase 2 — Categories, Items & Pricing

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] `Category`, `Item`, `ItemPriceHistory` schemas/modules
- [x] CRUD for categories and items (soft delete; category delete blocked when live items exist)
- [x] Price/cost update endpoint that appends to `ItemPriceHistory` + audit `price_changed`
- [x] Dev seed script: `npm run seed:catalog`

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Items list grouped by category, search/filters
- [x] Categories list page (create/edit modal, activate/deactivate/delete; delete blocked when items exist)
- [x] Add/edit item **modal** (pricing mode toggle; auto-generated editable code)
- [x] Price history **modal** per item
- [x] Soft-delete item with confirmation (row actions kebab menu)
- [x] Users page polish: row actions, create/edit admin modal, activate/deactivate/delete confirms

**Done when:** you can create categories/items from the UI, edit a price,
and see it recorded in that item's price history.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Categories | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /categories`, `GET /categories/:id` |
| Items | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /items`, `GET /items?categoryId&isActive`, `PATCH /items/:id/pricing`, `GET /items/:id/price-history` |

Modules: `src/modules/categories`, `items`.

- [x] Merge-duplicate endpoints for customers **and** suppliers (`دمج أسماء مكررة`)
- [x] Dev seed script: `npm run seed:parties`
- [x] Soft-delete audit actions: `category_deleted` / `item_deleted` / `customer_deleted` / `supplier_deleted`

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Customers list (sorted by balance, filter "has debt"), total debt + debtor count
- [x] Suppliers list, total owed at top
- [x] Add/edit modals for both (create-only opening balance/amount owed; optional address)
- [x] Detail pages (identity + balance/owed; no invoice/payment history in Phase 3)
- [x] Multi-source merge UI for customers and suppliers

**Done when:** you can add customers/suppliers, search them, and merge multiple
duplicate customers into one from the UI.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Customers | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /customers`, `GET /customers/:id`, `POST /customers/merge` |
| Suppliers | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /suppliers`, `GET /suppliers/:id`, `POST /suppliers/merge` |

List query params: `q`, `hasDebt`, `isActive`, `page`, `limit`. List response: `{ items, meta, summary }` (`totalDebt` / `totalOwed`).

Merge body: `{ targetId, sourceIds: string[], name?, phone? }` — keeps target, soft-deletes all sources, sums balances / amountOwed.

Module: `src/modules/sales-invoices`.

---

## Phase 5 — Payments (standalone debt payments)

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] Unit tests for formulas, defaults, validation, and bucket counts

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Dashboard page on `/`: today KPIs, debt strip, period chart + top sellers
- [x] `GET /dashboard` via `app/modules/dashboard` (service + hook); period `day|week|month|year` + date picker
- [x] Recharts bar chart (lazy-loaded); top sellers by revenue; EmptyState when none

## Phase 9 — Audit Log UI

**Backend**
- [x] Read-only query/filter over `AuditLog` (populated since Phase 1). No mutation endpoints.

**Frontend**
- [x] Audit log page with filters, plus a history modal from module and record screens

**Done when:** every action performed across Phases 1–8 is visible and
correctly attributed in the audit log UI.

`price_changed` writes `changes` as `{ unitPrice: { old, new } }` or `{ cost: { old, new } }`. `stock_adjusted` writes `{ stockQuantity: { old, new }, reason: { old: null, new } }` and names the item in `summary`.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Audit log | `GET /audit-logs` |
| Actors | `GET /audit-logs/actors` |

Query params on `GET /audit-logs` (all optional, AND-combined): `userId`, `action` (exact string), `entityType`, `entityId`, `from`, `to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, inclusive Cairo calendar days; `from` after `to` is 400), `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 10, max 100). Sort: `createdAt` descending. Paged list endpoints across the API use the same default `limit` of 10 and max of 100.

Response: `{ items: [{ id, createdAt, user: { id, username }, action, entityType, entityId, summary, changes, refCollection, refId }], meta: { page, limit, total } }`. A missing user document keeps the row with `username: null`.

`GET /audit-logs/actors`: `{ id, username }[]` of distinct users who appear on at least one log, including soft-deleted users. A missing user document is `{ id, username: null }`. Sorted by username ascending, null usernames first. Empty when there are no logs.

Module: `src/modules/audit` (backend); `app/modules/audit` (frontend).

- Responsive/mobile pass
- Loading / error / empty states everywhere
- API hardening: rate limiting, input validation edge cases, consistent
  error responses
