# Implementation Phases

> This file is duplicated identically in `Al-Mohamadia-Backend/docs/` and
> `Al-Mohamadia-Frontend/docs/` so each project has full system context
> without needing to open the other repo. Keep both copies in sync.

This project is built as a series of **vertical slices**: each phase
delivers a complete, end-to-end feature (DB schema → NestJS module → Next.js
pages), validated by actually driving the real frontend against the real
backend, before the next phase starts. Do not build "the whole backend"
then "the whole frontend" — and do not silently expand a phase's scope.

Update this file's checkboxes/status as phases complete (in both copies),
and update `docs/DATABASE.md` (backend) / `docs/Design-System.md` (frontend) /
`docs/OVERVIEW.md` in the same PR whenever a phase changes the
schema or business rules.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

No business feature yet; this unblocks every later phase.

**Backend**
- MongoDB connection module, global `@nestjs/config` + validation
- Global exception filter, consistent API response/error shape
- `AuditLog` schema + a shared `AuditService` other modules will call later
- API versioning under `/api/v1`, health check endpoint

**Frontend**
- Tailwind theme tokens wired from `docs/Design-System.md` (light/dark CSS variables)
- i18n setup: `ar` (default, RTL) / `en` (LTR) routing + dictionaries
- Root layout with `dir` + theme toggle + language toggle
- Shared API client wrapper (base URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
- Shared app shell (sidebar/nav placeholder, empty/loading/error states)

**Done when:** both apps run; you can flip language and theme in the
browser; the frontend successfully calls the backend's health endpoint.

---

## Phase 1 — Auth & Users

**Backend**
- `User`, `RefreshToken` schemas
- Register (super_admin only), login, refresh, logout endpoints
- JWT access + refresh token issuance/rotation (hashed refresh token storage)
- Role guards: `super_admin`, `admin`
- Seed script for the first super admin account

**Frontend**
- Login page
- Auth context/store, token refresh handling in the API client
- Protected route wrapper
- Super-admin-only "manage admins" page (create / deactivate admin)

**Done when:** you can log in as super admin from the UI, create an admin,
log in as that admin, and confirm the admin cannot access user-management
UI or API routes.

---

## Phase 2 — Categories, Items & Pricing

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] `Category`, `Item`, `ItemPriceHistory`, `Setting` schemas/modules
- [x] CRUD for categories and items (soft delete; category delete blocked when live items exist)
- [x] Price/cost update endpoint that appends to `ItemPriceHistory` + audit `price_changed`
- [x] Base reference price setting (سعر متر الخشب البلدي) via `settings`
- [x] Dev seed script: `npm run seed:catalog`

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Items list grouped by category, search/filters
- [x] Categories list page (create/edit modal, activate/deactivate/delete; delete blocked when items exist)
- [x] Add/edit item **modal** (pricing mode toggle; auto-generated editable code)
- [x] Price history **modal** per item
- [x] Soft-delete item with confirmation (row actions kebab menu)
- [x] Users page polish: row actions, create/edit admin modal, activate/deactivate/delete confirms

**Done when:** you can create categories/items from the UI, edit a price,
and see it recorded in that item's price history.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Categories | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /categories`, `GET /categories/:id` |
| Items | `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /items`, `GET /items?categoryId&isActive`, `PATCH /items/:id/pricing`, `GET /items/:id/price-history` |

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Customers list (sorted by balance, filter "has debt"), total debt + debtor count
- [x] Suppliers list, total owed at top

**Done when:** you can add customers/suppliers, search them, and merge multiple
duplicate customers into one from the UI.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):
