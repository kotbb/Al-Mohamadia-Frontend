# Implementation Phases

> Both repositories keep this system plan for local context. Repository-specific
> implementation notes may differ; keep shared API contracts, feature status
> and planned work aligned between the two copies.

This project is built as a series of **vertical slices**: each phase
delivers a complete, end-to-end feature (DB schema → NestJS module → Next.js
pages), validated by automated backend/frontend checks and user-run manual
frontend verification. Browser access is not part of agent verification unless
explicitly requested. Do not build "the whole backend"
then "the whole frontend" — and do not silently expand a phase's scope.

Update this file's checkboxes/status as phases complete (in both copies),
and update `docs/DATABASE.md` (backend) / `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (frontend) /
`docs/OVERVIEW.md` in the same PR whenever a phase changes the
schema or business rules.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

No business feature yet; this unblocks every later phase.

**Backend**
- MongoDB connection module, global `@nestjs/config` + validation
- Global exception filter, consistent API response/error shape
- `AuditLog` schema + a shared `AuditService` other modules will call later
- API versioning under `/api/v1`, health check endpoint

**Frontend**
- Tailwind theme tokens wired from `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (light/dark CSS variables)
- i18n setup: `ar` (default, RTL) / `en` (LTR) routing + dictionaries
- Root layout with `dir` + theme toggle + language toggle
- Shared API client wrapper (base URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
- Shared app shell (sidebar/nav placeholder, empty/loading/error states)

**Done when:** both apps run; you can flip language and theme in the
browser; the frontend successfully calls the backend's health endpoint.

---

## Phase 1 — Auth & Users

**Backend**
- `User`, `RefreshToken` schemas
- Register (super_admin only), login, refresh, logout endpoints
- JWT access + refresh token issuance/rotation (hashed refresh token storage)
- Role guards: `super_admin`, `admin`
- Seed script for the first super admin account

**Frontend**
- Login page
- Auth context/store, token refresh handling in the API client
- Protected route wrapper
- Super-admin-only "manage admins" page (create / deactivate admin)

**Done when:** you can log in as super admin from the UI, create an admin,
log in as that admin, and confirm the admin cannot access user-management
UI or API routes.

---

## Phase 2 — Categories, Items & Pricing

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] `Category`, `Item`, `ItemPriceHistory` schemas/modules
- [x] CRUD for categories and items (soft delete; category delete blocked when live items exist)
- [x] Price/cost update endpoint that appends to `ItemPriceHistory` + audit `price_changed`
- [x] Dev seed script: `npm run seed:catalog`

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Items list grouped by category, search/filters
- [x] Categories list page (create/edit modal, activate/deactivate/delete; delete blocked when items exist)

- [x] Price history **modal** per item
- [x] Soft-delete item with confirmation (row actions kebab menu)
- [x] Users page polish: row actions, create/edit admin modal, activate/deactivate/delete confirms

**Done when:** you can create categories/items from the UI, edit a price,
and see it recorded in that item's price history.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Categories | `POST/GET /categories`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /categories/:id` |

Module: `src/modules/sales-invoices`.

---

## Phase 5 — Payments (standalone debt payments)

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] Standalone payment endpoint (`POST /payments`) with strict validation:
  `customerId` required, `0 < amount <= customer.balance`, reduces
  `customer.balance` by `amount`, audit `payment_recorded`

- [x] Complete bilingual Arabic / English translations and responsive token-based styling

**Done when:** a purchase from a supplier increases stock and the
supplier's owed amount, supplier payments can be recorded and cancelled, both visible in the UI immediately.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Purchases | `POST/GET /purchases`, `GET /purchases/:id`, `POST /purchases/:id/cancel` |

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Stock List | `GET /inventory/stock` |
| Inventory Valuation | `GET /inventory/valuation` |

Module: `src/modules/inventory`.

---

## Phase 8 — Dashboard

**Backend** — *Done*

- [x] Aggregation endpoint `GET /dashboard`: today's sales (net) / estimated profit / invoice count / collected
- [x] Live customer debt KPI: `totalDebt` + `debtorCount` (`balance > 0`)
- [x] Period-filterable `salesSeries` (day / week / month / year, Cairo, zero-filled buckets) + top 5 selling items by revenue
- [x] Defaults to current Cairo month when `period`/`date` omitted; pair-validation matches other list endpoints
- [x] Unit tests for formulas, defaults, validation, and bucket counts

**Frontend** — *Done*

- [x] Dashboard page on `/`: today KPIs, debt KPI, period chart + top sellers
- [x] `GET /dashboard` via `app/modules/dashboard` (service + hook); period `day|week|month|year` + date picker
- [x] Recharts bar chart (lazy-loaded); top sellers by revenue; EmptyState when none
- [x] "New Invoice" AppShell action → `/invoices/new`; debt KPI → `/customers?hasDebt=1`
- [x] Removed Phase 0 Foundation home page

**Done when:** dashboard numbers match what you'd compute manually from the
invoices/payments created in earlier phases.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Dashboard | `GET /dashboard` |

Query params: `period` (`day` \| `week` \| `month` \| `year`) with `date`
(`YYYY-MM-DD`), or custom inclusive Cairo `from`/`to`. Default: current Cairo
month. The selected range applies to `periodFinancials`, `salesSeries` and
`topSellingItems`; today and live debt KPIs remain independent.

Response: `{ today: { sales, estimatedProfit, operatingExpenses, estimatedNetProfit, invoiceCount, collected }, periodFinancials: { sales, estimatedGrossProfit, operatingExpenses, estimatedNetProfit }, debt: { totalDebt, debtorCount }, period: { period, date, from, to }, salesSeries: [{ bucketStart, sales }], topSellingItems: [{ itemId, name, code, quantity, revenue }] }`. `today.estimatedProfit` retains its existing gross-profit meaning. Custom ranges return `period.period = "custom"`.

Module: `src/modules/dashboard` (backend); `app/modules/dashboard` (frontend).

---

## Phase 9 — Audit Log UI

**Backend**
- [x] Read-only query/filter over `AuditLog` (populated since Phase 1). No mutation endpoints.

**Frontend**
- [x] Audit log page with filters, plus a history modal from module and record screens

**Done when:** every action performed across Phases 1–8 is visible and
correctly attributed in the audit log UI.

`price_changed` writes `changes` as `{ unitPrice: { old, new } }` or `{ cost: { old, new } }`. `stock_adjusted` writes `{ stockQuantity: { old, new }, reason: { old: null, new } }` and names the item in `summary`.

**Backend API** (`/api/v1`, JWT + `admin` | `super_admin`):

| Resource | Endpoints |
|----------|-----------|
| Audit log | `GET /audit-logs` |
| Actors | `GET /audit-logs/actors` |

Query params on `GET /audit-logs` (all optional, AND-combined): `userId`, `action` (exact string), `entityType`, `entityId`, `from`, `to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, inclusive Cairo calendar days; `from` after `to` is 400), `page` (default 1), `limit` (default 10, max 100). Sort: `createdAt` descending. Paged list endpoints across the API use the same default `limit` of 10 and max of 100.

Response: `{ items: [{ id, createdAt, user: { id, username }, action, entityType, entityId, summary, changes, refCollection, refId }], meta: { page, limit, total } }`. A missing user document keeps the row with `username: null`.

`GET /audit-logs/actors`: `{ id, username }[]` of distinct users who appear on at least one log, including soft-deleted users. A missing user document is `{ id, username: null }`. Sorted by username ascending, null usernames first. Empty when there are no logs.

Module: `src/modules/audit` (backend); `app/modules/audit` (frontend).

The frontend localizes known audit summaries, change-field labels, and coded values for Arabic and English while preserving stored summaries and dynamic names/numbers. Unknown summary formats fall back to their sanitized stored text.

---

## Operating expenses extension

- Run `npm run seed:expenses` in the backend once to insert starter categories;
  reruns keep renamed and deactivated categories intact.
- [x] Finance sidebar destination and bilingual operating expense ledger.
- [x] Current Cairo month default, filterable paginated list with full-filter
  active totals, category management, detail/edit forms, and confirmed soft delete.
- [x] Custom inclusive From/To Cairo dates beside Day/Week/Month/Year across
  invoice, payment, purchase, supplier payment, dashboard, and expense filters.
- [x] Dashboard relabels existing estimated profit as gross profit and shows
  paid expenses and estimated net profit for today and the selected period.

## Phase 10 — Polish & Hardening

- Full i18n pass (no missed/hardcoded strings in either language)
- Full light/dark pass against `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` tokens
- Responsive/mobile pass
- Loading / error / empty states everywhere
- API hardening: rate limiting, input validation edge cases, consistent
  error responses
- Deployment setup (backend + frontend) — deferred

---

## Status tracking

| 10 — Polish & Hardening | Implemented; runtime validation pending | Implemented; manual visual checks pending |

### Compact inventory and invoice dimension additions

- [x] Compact inventory category tables retain eight columns, counts for the current page, existing actions, filters and pagination.
- [x] Localized item creation/edit pages replace catalog form modals.
- [x] Shared dashed Add line/Add value buttons and invoice preset addition for sales create/edit and purchase create.
- [x] POST /api/v1/items/:id/dimension-defaults appends positive meter defaults transactionally with item-edit auditing; duplicates are no-ops.
- [ ] Manual visual/interaction checks in both languages and on mobile (browser access intentionally skipped).

## Current workflow additions

- [x] Invoice export page defaults to PNG A5; PDF A4, price visibility, printing and sharing remain available.
- [x] Shared loading screen for route/auth transitions; global/localized error and not-found surfaces.
- [x] Root AGENTS.md is the single instruction file in each repository; architecture checks run before builds.
- [ ] Manual English/Arabic, light/dark and mobile verification remains separate from automated checks.

## Planned: recurring operating expenses

Not implemented: configurable repeat intervals, first/optional end dates, due/overdue occurrences, one full payment per occurrence, skip reasons, pause/resume/stop, and dashboard due counts. Only confirmed payments will enter the existing paid ledger. Email reminders and partial payments are deferred. No recurrence collections, endpoints or scheduler exist yet.

## Navigation and receipt presentation

- [x] Invoice-first Sales & Customers and Purchases & Suppliers hubs; clickable customer/supplier/sales/purchase rows retain independent nested actions and brown primary-link hover.
- [x] Expense ledger/detail use stable localized date-only formatting.
- [x] Numeric invoice neighbors supplement existing customer chronology with cancelled/cash invoices, gap handling and numeric collation.
- [x] Resolved receipt pricing snapshots support cubic per-piece display without changing stored rates/totals.
- [ ] Manual language/mobile/hover/export checks remain separate from automated verification.


### Validation and invoice navigation refinement

Implemented optional Egyptian mobile validation, preserved unchanged legacy phones, partial phone indexes (the package-listed check/repair script is currently absent), trimmed required-text/null guards, consistent opening/item monetary precision, and finite positive cubic write guards across the two repositories. Invoice navigation uses a mode selector and labeled Previous/Next arrows; Arabic PDF guidance is also shown on public receipts and excluded from printed/downloaded output. Existing records are not rewritten. Manual English/Arabic/mobile checks remain user-run.


### Current locale, phone and Finance controls

- Arabic/RTL is the unprefixed default with locale detection disabled; explicit
  English routes remain LTR. Theme and language switches live in the user menu.
- Optional Egyptian mobiles accept local/+20 formats and use English digits.
  The ten-digit international portion keeps generic `1XX XXX XXXX` guidance.
  Errors appear on invalid submit attempts, not while typing or on blur.
- Finance Custom From/To fields stay beside the preset selector on desktop,
  with reserved width, and stack on smaller screens. Expense dates remain
  date-only; no payment time has been added. Record creation is a separate timestamp.
